**Visualization--Loading-of-a-Beam-**
"Loading of a Beam" is a Python application that allows users to analyze and visualize beams by calculating reaction forces, bending moments, and shear force diagrams. The program provides options to input data manually or read data from a file in a specific format. It supports different types of beams, such as simply supported, overhanging, and cantilever beams, and utilizes the Turtle graphics library to visually represent the beams, shear force diagrams, and bending moment diagrams.

**How to Run the Program**
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the **"loadingbeam.py"** file and run it using a Python interpreter.
3. The program will prompt the user to choose between manual input or reading data from a file.
     - If you choose manual input, follow the instructions provided by the program.
     - If you choose to read from a file, enter the correct text file name.
6. Once the necessary inputs are provided, the program will proceed with the calculations and generate the visualizations.
